# DjangoTestDrive
This is a simple application written in Python using Django. All it does is take you to a form and asks you to fill out
student registration for Lipscomb. The backend uses MySql for the database.

# Run server
To run this locally on your computer, all you need to do is clone the files. You also need to make sure you have Python 3
installed. Then run:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
And it will start a local server on you computer and display the webpage. I hope you can learn something from it. Also note,
I am not an expert in Django, I spent 8 hours in one day learning just enough to use Django and then applied my knowledge 
to create this. So the practices represented in this project are not the best practices by far.
